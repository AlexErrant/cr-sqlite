# basic-browser-setup

While we have example apps ([todomvc](https://github.com/vlcn-io/cr-sqlite/tree/main/js/examples/todomvc), strut), this provides examples of how to load and run `crsqlite` in the browser, with no additional fluff.

```
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

Open up the link in the console, `index.html` will tell you what to do from there.
